I'm not sure what this is exactly, but currently I'm thinking it's a mashup between a blog and a wiki. Some content is about a well-defined topic, and the point is to refine the content until it gets better. That's the wiki part. Other content is for writing to be done that's not specifically about one topic, or is about several topics all at once. It's emphasis is more about the arrangement of the well-defined topics, about which ones to emphasize. I'm not really sure yet.
